Intro to Game Programming
=========================

This example is meant to be minimal changes to a single example from the
tutorial, to show the simplicity of using transylvania engine as a drop in
replacement for parts of pygame.

Developed for the Intro to Game Programming tutorial at US PyCon 2012,
revised for PyCon APAC 2012, 2013 and 2014 by Richard Jones.
