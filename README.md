Transylvania Engine
===================

The purpose of this project is to create a clean and simple to use side
scrolling game engine using SDL2 and OpenGL.  The display will be configured
using orthographic projection using textured polygons as sprites.  Depth can
be used specifically for layering.  Using this approach will allow for
the creation of advanced effects using GLSL.

TODO
----
* Time based render rather than incrementing the frame in the draw method.
* Fix Sprite transparency.
